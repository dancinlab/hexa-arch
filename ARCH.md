## 1. One-line shape

`demiurge` is a graph of **domains** with **prerequisite edges**
between them, where each domain has **7 verb cells** that dispatch
to **substrates** living in **hexa-lang** (or sibling hexa-* repos),
and the cockpit reads the resulting **typed records** under a
single **honesty gate** (g3).

```

## 2. Domains — graph, not partition (D78)

### 2.1 Nodes

18 domains live under `domains/<name>.md`. Each one is a node in the
domain graph. Domain ≠ project; the project is a *pointer* (D-pending,
see §5).

```
Molecular tier (substrate-heavy):  matter · chem · bio
Device tier:                       chip · firmware · sscb · rtsc ·
                                   brain · aura
Component tier:                    component · bot
System tier:                       energy · grid · mobility · scope ·
                                   space · cern · antimatter · fusion
```

*Tier = facet tag, not a partition.* A domain can carry multiple
tags (D78 picked option 3). See §2.3.

### 2.2 Prerequisite edges (DAG)

Each `domains/<name>.md` carries a header field:

```yaml
prerequisites: [<other domain ids>]
```

The collection of edges forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG) — when
a project picks a *start domain*, the system traverses its transitive
closure and proposes the upstream domains to include.

Example chains (illustrative, exact edges live in each `domains/*.md`):

```
- bio (drug discovery)  →  chem (synthesis)  →  matter (formulation)
- chem (catalyst)       →  matter (carrier)
- fusion                →  rtsc (HTS coil)   →  matter (cryostat alloy)
- chip                  →  firmware                — software on top
- scope                 →  component (optics frame) → matter
```

Two domains can share an upstream prerequisite (e.g., both `bio` and
`chem` may depend on `matter`); this is why a DAG (not a tree) is the
correct shape.

### 2.3 Facet tags

Each domain header also carries:

```yaml
facets:
  scale:    Molecular | Device | Component | System
  cluster:  matter | bio | chem | physical | engineering | system | ...
  hostility: macos-clean | macos-partial | macos-blocked | linux-pool
```

Facets are **multi-tag**, not mutually-exclusive partitions — `bio`
might carry `cluster: [bio, chem]` if its prerequisite chain crosses
both clusters. The cockpit *New Project* UI uses facets only as a
filter for the initial domain pick.

### 2.4 Why graph, not strict partition

User observation (2026-05-20): real systems cross-cut domains. A drug
project touches `bio` (target) + `chem` (molecule) + `matter`
(formulation) + `component` (delivery device). Forcing each domain
into a single tier creates false either/or choices and hides the real
prerequisite relationships. D78 picked option 3 = graph DAG +
multi-facet tag.

### 2.5 Example — `domains/ufo.md` (HEXA-Disc, 7-stage propulsion)

The canonical worked example for "graph, not partition" + "multi-level
DAG" — a top-of-stack domain whose **direct** prerequisites are three
sister sibling repos (`hexa-fusion`, `hexa-antimatter`, `hexa-rtsc`),
each of which **transitively** depends on `rtsc` as a foundation
technology. The sibling-repo `~/core/hexa-ufo/` README §Status anchors
the mapping (Stage-1 Meissner → rtsc · Stage-2 cruise → fusion ·
Stage-3 orbital → antimatter).

```yaml
# domains/ufo.md — header (D78 schema, Option 3: direct prereq only)
prerequisites:
  - fusion       # Stage-2 MHD + tabletop fusion cruise
  - antimatter   # Stage-3 antiproton γ-rocket orbital
  - rtsc         # Stage-1 Meissner diamagnetism (direct)

facets:
  scale:    System
  cluster:  [physical, propulsion]           # multi-tag, not partition
  hostility: macos-clean                     # all 3 substrates macOS-clean

substrate_ssot: ~/core/hexa-ufo/             # D17 sibling-repo precedent
                                             #   v1.0.0, DOI 10.5281/zenodo.20102628
```

DAG fragment (3-level: foundation → application → integration):

```
                 ┌─────┐
                 │ ufo │              ← LEVEL 3 (integration apex)
                 └──┬──┘
            ┌───────┼───────┐
            │       │       │
       ┌────▼───┐ ┌─▼─────┐ │
       │ fusion │ │antimat│ │         ← LEVEL 2 (application)
       └────┬───┘ └──┬────┘ │
            │        │      │
            └────────┼──────┘
                     │
                ┌────▼────┐
                │  rtsc   │           ← LEVEL 1 (foundation)
                └─────────┘

direct prereq edges (Option 3 schema):
  ufo → {fusion, antimatter, rtsc}
  fusion → {rtsc, ...}          (per domains/fusion.md cross-refs)
  antimatter → {matter, rtsc}   (Penning trap SC magnet + trap matter)

transitive closure (computed by graph traversal, NOT stored):
  ufo* = {fusion, antimatter, rtsc, matter, ...}
```

**Why this is the chosen example**:
- **Multi-level DAG** is visibly necessary — `rtsc` shows up once as
  ufo's direct prereq (Stage-1 Meissner) **and** transitively through
  `fusion` and `antimatter`. Storing only direct edges (Option 3)
  keeps the SSOT minimal; the cockpit traversal proposes the closure.
- **rtsc-as-foundation** is real — `domains/grid.md` cross-references
  `rtsc` for HTS power cable, `fusion` uses tokamak SC coils,
  `antimatter` uses Penning trap SC magnets, `cern` uses LHC SC
  dipoles. Stripping rtsc breaks ≥4 downstream domains.
- **Sibling-repo pattern** (`~/core/hexa-ufo/`) makes the D17 / D77
  boundary concrete — substrate too large for one stdlib subtree, so
  it lives outside. The demiurge-side `domains/ufo.md` is a pointer.
- **Speculative tail honestly tracked** — `~/core/hexa-ufo/` Stages
  4–7 (warp / wormhole / dim-jump / dim-use) carry **13 OPEN
  falsifiers** (F-WARP-1..3 / F-WORM-1..3 / F-DIM-1..3 / F-USE-1..4).
  All UNPROVEN at v1.0.0. The demiurge cell layer respects this:
  any ufo+verify record carries scope_caveats spelling out that
  bookkeeping-closure ≠ empirical truth (g3).

**Project example over the same graph** — a "ufo close-encounter
trace" project (cockpit "New Project" flow):

```
step 1.  Facet filter: cluster=propulsion          → narrows to ufo + chain
step 2.  Pick start domain = ufo
step 3.  Auto-propose transitive closure:
            [rtsc, matter, fusion, antimatter, ufo]
                 ^foundation              ^integration apex
step 4.  Project.walk = topological sort of the closure
         Project.startDomain = ufo
         Project.verbState = per-domain 7-verb state
```

The same `domains/ufo.md` node serves any number of projects (D78 —
"domain ≠ project, project is pointer over the graph"). A drug-discovery
project would start at `bio` and traverse `{chem, matter}` — a
completely different transitive closure over the same graph.

---

## 3. The 7-verb spine (D5)

Every domain carries the same seven verbs, each of which dispatches
a *cell*:

```
명세 (specify)  → architecture spec, IETF/AUTOSAR-class doc, cited
구조 (structure)→ topology / task tree / inventory
설계 (design)   → real source artifact (RTL, KiCad, C, URDF, .step)
해석⟲ (analyze) → simulation, what-if, error analysis
합성 (synthesize)→ build the deliverable
검증 (verify)   → independent measurement against an oracle
인계 (handoff)  → packaged release + SBOM + cited audit trail
```

A (verb, domain) pair = a *cell*. With 18 domains × 7 verbs = 126
cells. Of those, ROI 1→18 (currently 17) have a real engine tool
dispatched; the rest fall back to the LLM "honest-gap" path.

---

## 4. Substrate & kernel layer (D17 / D61 / D72)

### 4.1 Where the math lives

`demiurge/` carries *no* compute code. Every producer script is owned
by `hexa-lang/stdlib/` (D17 / D61). The Swift `Producer.swift` in
demiurge spawns `python3 ~/core/hexa-lang/stdlib/<domain>/<script>.py
<output_dir>` and decodes the resulting JSON into a typed Record.

### 4.2 D72 — two-layer kernel

```
hexa-lang/stdlib/
├── kernels/              ①a domain-agnostic math (13 today)
│   ├── graph/  fem/  mc_transport/  orbital/  wave_optics/
│   ├── noc_sim/  logic_synth/  circuit/  plasma/  neural/
│   ├── signal_proc/  urdf/  solar/
│   └── (cfd, ode_pde, ...)  planned
│
└── <domain>/             ①b thin domain adapter
    ├── component/gmsh_skfem.py    → calls kernels/fem/
    ├── grid/networkx_basics.py    → calls kernels/graph/
    ├── cern/xsuite_optics.py      → adapter-only (single domain)
    └── ... (15 today, +chem, +bio post-D77 = 17)
```

A kernel may have many adapters. Example payoff:
`kernels/mc_transport/` is consumed by **4** domain adapters
(antimatter+analyze, fusion+verify, energy+verify, antimatter+verify)
— the N+M reuse the D72 layer was designed for.

### 4.3 D74 — ProducerRegistry (cells with alternatives)

Most cells have one substrate; a few carry alternatives. Example:
`(cern, analyze)` has both `pylhe` (legacy LHE round-trip) and
`xsuite-tracking` (real physics, default). ActionDispatch consults
`ProducerRegistry.entries` first; missing keys fall through to the
hardcoded switch (additive, not invasive).

```
ActionDispatch.runEngineTool(verb, domain, producer:)
    │
    ├─ ProducerRegistry.entries[(verb, domain)]?
    │   ├─ entry.pick(producer ?? default) → variant.run()
    │   └─ unknown producer → honest no-record
    │
    └─ switch (verb, domain) → hardcoded Producer.run() (default)
```

CLI: `action analyze cern --producer pylhe`.

### 4.4 Sibling repos (D17 / D77)

`hexa-lang` is the single SSOT for stdlib code. A handful of
substrate domains live in *sibling repos* because their full
substrate tree is much larger than what fits as one stdlib subtree:

```
~/core/hexa-matter/   — material synthesis substrate (D17 precedent)
~/core/hexa-bio/      — molecular biology substrate (D77, planned)
~/core/hexa-chem/     — chemistry substrate (D77, planned)
```

The demiurge-side domain (`domains/matter.md`, `domains/bio.md`,
`domains/chem.md`) is a **pointer** — it carries the deliverable
spec + cited sources, and its substrate scripts spawn into the
sibling repo. `hexa-lang/stdlib/<domain>/` for these three points
to the sibling repo's entry script rather than holding the math.

---

## 5. Projects — pointers over the graph

```
struct Project {
    let id: ProjectID
    let name: String
    let createdAt: Date

    // Pointer-only — does NOT own domain content.
    let startDomain: DomainID
    let walk: [DomainID]   // ordered chain (incl. prerequisites)

    // Mutable run state lives on the project; producers' typed
    // Records live under exports/<domain>/<cell>/<stamp>/.
    var verbState: [Verb: VerbState]
    var manifestPath: URL   // D45 — App Support persisted JSON
}
```

The project never modifies `domains/*.md`. The cockpit "New Project"
wizard:

```
step 1.  Facet filter (cluster + scale)         — narrows the 18 nodes
step 2.  Pick start domain (e.g., bio)          — graph traversal
step 3.  Confirm prerequisite chain             — DAG transitive closure
step 4.  Project name + manifest persistence    — App Support (D45)
```

A project may add or remove a domain from its `walk` later; the
underlying `domains/*.md` graph is unaffected. Multiple projects can
share the same domain (a single SSOT).

---

## 6. SceneDescriptor (D76)

3D viewers in the cockpit are *not* hardcoded per domain. Instead:

```
domains/*.md → toScene() → SceneDescriptor (Codable Swift)
                              │
                              │  primitive enum:
                              │   box · annulus · helixTube · sphere ·
                              │   mesh · arrow · label
                              │
                              ▼
            GenericSceneView3D (RealityKit ARView)
              ├─ orbit drag / scroll zoom
              └─ MeshDescriptor helpers (annulus / helix tube / ...)
```

`ComponentGeometry.toScene()` and `RtscGeometry.toScene()` are the
first two emitters; the goal is for every domain that *has* a
geometry to emit a SceneDescriptor instead of a custom view. The
domain-specific Views (`ComponentView3D`, `RtscView3D`) are
deprecated once their toScene() is wired and visually verified.

---

## 7. Records, gates, honesty (D9 / D12 / g3)

Every Producer emits a typed `Record` (Swift Codable) carrying:

```swift
struct Provenance {
    let absorbed: Bool                     // false until measured parity
    let producer: String                   // "lib@ver" — NOT the part
    let measurementGate: MeasurementGate   // OPEN / B_PINNED_MET /
                                           // CLOSED_MEASURED / FAILED
    let scopeCaveats: [String]             // honest what-this-isn't
}
```

`absorbed=true` flips ONLY on a *measured* gate — typically a cited
analytic oracle or an external benchmark hit within a stated
tolerance. Two dynamic flips so far: chip §B+§D (κ-43, D70) and
cern+synth (κ-51, vs Wiedemann/Lee). Everything else is
`GATE_OPEN, absorbed=false`. The `scope_caveats` field is
*non-optional* — every record carries an explicit list of what the
measurement does NOT cover.

The g3 contract: never silent-pass, never over-claim, never set a
gate without a citation. Install-gated and platform-gated skips are
honest: the substrate emits a record with `skipped_reason` set and
`absorbed=false` rather than crashing or falsifying success.

---

## 8. Cockpit (UI) layer (D26 / D35 / D41)

```

```

The cockpit reads `domains/*.md`, `exports/<domain>/*` and the
manifest JSON; it never writes to `domains/*.md`. AR / visionOS is
the stated portability target (n_cockpit_ar_target) — that's why
RealityKit (not SceneKit) is the 3D layer.

## 11. Worked simulations (design test, not implementation)

Two end-to-end project simulations were run *on paper* to design-test
the §2 graph + §5 project-pointer + §7 honesty model before the .demi
parser + DomainGraph code landed. Each simulation walks a hypothetical
user from `New Project` through every cell of the transitive closure,
recording where the design holds and where the gaps appear. These are
**not** measured records — they are design walk-throughs, kept as
canon test cases.

### 11.1 Simulation A — `alien-disc-mk1` (ufo from scratch)

User opens cockpit → New Project wizard. cluster=propulsion filter
narrows the 19 nodes; user picks `ufo` as the start domain; DAG
transitive closure proposes `{ufo, fusion, antimatter, rtsc, matter}`
(matter via antimatter prereq edge); user names "alien-disc-mk1".

```
T+0   New Project wizard
        Step 1. facet filter   : cluster=propulsion
        Step 2. start domain   : ufo

                                  ^integration            ^foundation
        Step 4. project name   : "alien-disc-mk1"
        manifest 저장 → ~/.config/demiurge/projects/alien-disc-mk1.json

T+1   topological walk (foundation → integration)

**Simulation A — gaps discovered (G1–G5)**

```
✅ 잘 작동
  - DAG closure traversal: 5 도메인 자동 chain (Day 1→5 토폴로지 정렬)
  - g3 honesty: 35 cells 중 1개만 진짜 absorbed=true (matter), 정직
  - sibling repo pointer: ufo → hexa-ufo dispatch 자연 매핑
  - 13 falsifier preregister: 미증명 explicit OPEN (g3 위반 0)

⚠️ 갭 (현재 demiurge 가 부족)
  G1. cockpit 새 프로젝트 wizard 가 아직 facet → DAG 인지 X
      (현 NewProjectSheet 는 평면 list, D78 implementation 필요)
  G2. cell-skipped 일관 보고 UI 없음 (record JSON 안 매몰)
      → "왜 skipped 인지" project-level dashboard 필요
  G3. domains/matter/* pointer 가 D17 산출 (absorbed=true)을 어떻게
      cell record 로 surface 하는지 ActionDispatch 매끄럽지 않음
  G4. ufo 의 sister-repo dispatch — 현재 `hexa-ufo selftest` spawn 패턴 없음
      (sscb/cern/scope 처럼 stdlib/<domain>/*.py 가 아니라 외부
       sibling repo CLI binary 호출 → ProducerRegistry 확장 필요)
  G5. 13 falsifier preregister CSV 가 cell record schema 와 별개
      → ufo+verify Record 가 falsifier 표를 typed field 로 담아야

🛠️ design 통찰 (D78 graph + .demi format 이 풀어주는 갭)
  - G1 → DomainGraph.transitiveClosure(id) + cockpit wizard 갱신
  - G2 → exports/*/skipped.summary.json + ProvenanceBanner 확장
  - G3 → MatterAnalyzer 의 pointer-pattern 을 generic 패턴화
         (sibling-repo dispatch 표준화)
  - G4 → ProducerRegistry 의 variant.run 이 sibling-repo binary 도 spawn

```
✅ ufo 시뮬레이션 갭 (G1-G5) 모두 재발견 — pattern 일관

🆕 aura 시뮬레이션이 새로 발견:
  G6. Cascade falsifier — hexa-aura README 의 conditional rule
      "if hexa-rtsc falls → F-AURA-2 DEMOTED" 가 명시.
      이건 cross-domain *falsifier dependency* — DAG edge 의 일종.
      현재 DomainGraph 에 falsifier-cascade 표현 없음.
      → FalsifierEntry 에 `demoted_if: <other-falsifier-id>` 필드 추가
         또는 DomainGraph 가 falsifier 도 node 화 (super-graph)

  G7. Proprietary-mandatory gate — Sim4Life FDA MDDT 같은
      open 대체 없는 도구가 cell verify path 의 정직 차단.
      현재 substrate gate ("install 안 됨") 와 commercial gate
      ("FDA 의무, OSS 없음") 가 구분 안 됨.
      → record schema 에 gate_type: install | platform | regulatory |
         proprietary-irreplaceable 필드

  G8. n=6 lattice invariant cross-check —
      σ·φ = n·τ = J₂ = 24 가 모든 HEXA-family 의 invariant.
      aura/cern/ufo/rtsc/bio/chip 6 sibling 이 모두 이 invariant 공유.
      → DemiurgeCore 에 LatticeInvariant 모듈 (assertion engine)
         project-wide audit 가능

🛠️ 통찰
  - ufo + aura 둘 다 *integration apex* 패턴 (DAG top, sibling sub repos)
  - n=6 lattice 가 cross-project 공통 invariant — 별도 audit 의미 있음
  - falsifier cascade (cross-domain) 가 진짜 cross-domain bookkeeping
    의 핵심 — demiurge 의 정직성 표면의 핵심 case
```

prereq. 도메인 = 다중 프로젝트 공유 노드 (사용자 명시: "완성된 도메인은
여기저기 쓰일 수 있으니까").

**Integrated gap list (G1–G8)**

```
🎯 새 갭 통합 list (G1-G8)

G1. cockpit NewProjectSheet — facet → DAG 인지 (D78 impl 핵심)
G2. cell-skipped 일관 보고 UI
G3. sibling-repo pointer pattern 표준화 (matter / ufo / aura)
G4. ProducerRegistry 가 sibling-repo binary spawn
G5. FalsifierEntry 가 record schema typed field
G6. Cascade falsifier (cross-domain DEMOTE rule)
G7. gate_type 구분 (install / platform / regulatory / proprietary)
G8. n=6 lattice invariant cross-check 엔진
```

우선순위 추천:
- **첫 라운드**: G1 + G3 + G5 (D78 graph + sibling pattern + falsifier typed) — 가장 fundamental
- **둘째 라운드**: G2 + G7 (UI / gate_type 정직성 표면)
- **셋째 라운드**: G4 + G6 + G8 (cascade + lattice audit)

비교 — 기존 EDA = project-bound (각 프로젝트가 자기 도메인 데이터 자체 보유).
demiurge = domain-shared (도메인 1개 + 프로젝트 N 개 포인터). 시뮬레이션 두 개가
rtsc 공유로 직접 입증. monolithic CAD 가 못 하는 cross-domain bookkeeping 정직성
표면.

**라운드 1 — fundamental (D78 + sibling + falsifier schema)**

- [x] **G1.** cockpit `NewProjectSheet` — facet → DAG 인지
  - **κ-56**: `Domain.swift` 에 prerequisites + facets fields 추가.
    `DomainGraph.swift` 신규 (transitiveClosure / topologicalSort /
    byScale / byCluster / roots / leaves). DomainCatalog 19 entries
    에 prereq + facet 박음.
  - **κ-57**: D83 `.demi` format + `domains/INDEX.demi` (19
    `[<id>]` records) + `DemiParser.swift` + `DomainLoader.swift` 신규.
    `DomainCatalog.all` 가 runtime-load (loadAllOrFallback). 도메인
    추가는 이제 `.demi` 한 section (Swift 변경 0).
  - **κ-58**: D84 2-tier (built-in + user `u/` prefix). `DomainLoader.
    loadUserDomains()` + Project.walk 필드. user 도메인이 built-in
    prereq 로 사용 가능 (DAG 자연 확장).
  - **κ-59**: `NewProjectSheet` step 3 (confirm) 에 DAG closure
    preview chip stack 추가. `closureWalk` computed property 가
    `DomainGraph.transitiveClosure` + `topologicalSort` 호출. start
    도메인은 accent 색, prereq chain 은 secondary chip 으로 표시.
    `u/<id>` 도메인은 "내 도메인" badge. Project.walk 가 closure 로
    자동 채워져서 onCreate 호출. `build CockpitApp` OK (2.94s).

    - `DemiurgeCLI action list-domains --facet cluster=propulsion` 작동
    - cockpit 새 wizard 3-step 매뉴얼 검증

- [x] **G3.** sibling-repo pointer pattern 표준화 (matter / ufo / aura)
  - **κ-56**: `SiblingRepoSpawner.swift` 신규 (D17 entrypoint
    resolver + uniform spawn — `~/core/hexa-<id>/cli/hexa-<id>` 또는
    fallback `verify/run_all.hexa` 등 canonical 후보 4개 자동 시도).
  - **κ-60 decision (no-refactor)**: `MatterAnalyzer.swift` 는 D17
    historical precedent 로 **그대로 보존**. commit-hash pin / per-
    script PASS parsing / closure-invariant gate 결정 등 hexa-matter
    특화 처리가 generic helper 로 흡수하면 손실. 미래 sibling-cell
    (ufo / aura / cern / antimatter / fusion / rtsc / space / brain /
    bio / chem) Producer 가 SiblingRepoSpawner 사용하는 게 G3 목표
    충족 (regression 위험 0).

    - 새 도메인이 sibling-repo 포인터 등록할 때 코드 1줄 (`SiblingRepoSpawner.spawn(.aura)`)

- [x] **G5.** `FalsifierEntry` 가 record schema typed field
  - **κ-56**: `FalsifierEntry.swift` 신규 (typed monotone OPEN /
    CONFIRMED / DEMOTED + demotedIf for G6 cascade).
  - **κ-60**: `UfoVerifyRecord.swift` + `AuraVerifyRecord.swift` 신규
    (typed Codable). 각각 `falsifiers: [FalsifierEntry]?` 필드 +
    `hexaNativeParity: HexaNativeParityRef?` (D80) +

**라운드 2 — 정직성 표면**

- [x] **G2.** cell-skipped 일관 보고 UI
  - **κ-61**: `SkippedCellsAggregator.swift` 신규 (Foundation only,
    `exports/` 디렉토리 scan + 모든 JSON 의 `skipped_reason` field
    수집 + GateType 자동 추정 fallback heuristic).
    `SkippedCellsDashboard.swift` 신규 (SwiftUI) — gate-type chip
    summary + filter + 셀 list + "내가 풀 수 있는 갭" count
    (userResolvable). 모든 17+ dispatched cell 이 통일 dashboard 안에
    visible.
  - deps: G1 부분 (DomainGraph 가 cell coverage 알아야)
  - runtime artifact:
    - 각 project 의 `exports/<domain>/skipped.summary.json` —
      verb × cell × skipped_reason 매트릭스
  - edit:
    - `cockpit/Sources/CockpitApp/Views/ProvenanceBanner.swift` 확장
      → "이 cell 이 왜 skipped 인지" 한 줄 표시
    - 새 view `SkippedCellsDashboard.swift` (project pane 안 별도 탭)
  - exit:
    - alien-disc-mk1 / aura-clip-mk1 모두 dashboard 에 skipped 이유
      clean 표시 (29/27 cell 중 X 가 install-gated, Y 가 platform-blocked)

- [x] **G7.** `gate_type` 구분 (install / platform / regulatory / proprietary)
  - **κ-61**: `GateType.swift` 신규 — `installGated` / `platformGated`
    / `dataGated` / `regulatoryGated` / `proprietaryOnly` /
    `hexaNativeAbsent` (D80 surface) / `producerAbsent` /
    `unspecified` 8 case. `userResolvable` predicate (user 설치/다운로드
    로 풀 수 있는 갭) + `hexaNativeBlocked` predicate (G6/D80 cascade).
    각 case 가 Korean label 보유 (cockpit ProvenanceBanner + G2
    dashboard 사용). substrate 측 typed emit 점진 적용 — 그 동안
    G2 aggregator 가 skipped_reason text 에서 heuristic fallback.
  - deps: G5 (Record schema 변경 같이 가는 게 효율)
  - edit:
    - `F1F2Record.swift` 의 `MeasurementGate` enum 에 `gate_type`
      소속 field 추가 OR scope_caveats 안 typed key
      ```
      enum GateType: String, Codable {
          case installGated         // brew install missing
          case platformGated        // macOS Wine / Linux only

      (예: "23/42 install-gated, 5/42 regulatory-gated proprietary-only")

**라운드 3 — cross-domain audit**

- [x] **G4.** `ProducerRegistry` 가 sibling-repo binary spawn
  - **κ-62**: `ProducerRegistry+Sibling.swift` 신규 — extension on
    `ProducerRegistry` with `siblingRepoVariant(id:domainID:verb:
    displayName:)` factory. variant.run closure 가 `SiblingRepoSpawner.
    spawn` 호출 + `exports/<domain>/<verb>/<stamp>/` 디렉토리 자동
    생성 + emitted JSON 으로부터 recordID 추출. cern+analyze 의
    pylhe / xsuite-tracking 패턴이 일반화됨 — 새 (verb, domain) cell
    이 sibling-repo binary 인계 받을 때 entries dict 한 줄 추가
    (`"hexa-ufo": ProducerRegistry.siblingRepoVariant(...)`).
  - deps: G3 (`SiblingRepoSpawner` 헬퍼 먼저)
  - edit:
    - `ProducerRegistry.swift` 확장 — variant.run closure 안에서
      `SiblingRepoSpawner.spawn(.hexa_ufo, command: "selftest")` 호출
    - cern+analyze pylhe / xsuite-tracking 패턴 (D74) 을 sibling-repo
      variant 로 확장: `(ufo, synthesize)` → `hexa-ufo CLI` variant
  - exit:
    - 새 도메인이 sibling-repo CLI 인계 받을 때 entries dict 1 줄

- [x] **G6.** Cascade falsifier (cross-domain DEMOTE rule)
  - **κ-62**: `FalsifierCascade.swift` 신규 — BFS over `demotedIf`
    edges. `apply(_ entries:)` 가 monotone fixpoint (OPEN entry 가
    upstream DEMOTED 면 본인도 DEMOTED, CONFIRMED/DEMOTED 는 freeze).
    `FalsifierCascadeResult` = updated entries + diagnostic
    `[FalsifierCascadeHop]` (target / cause / reason) — cockpit
    dashboard 에서 "demoted because of …" 표시 가능. hexa-aura README
    의 "if hexa-rtsc falls → F-AURA-2 DEMOTED" 정확 매핑.
  - deps: G5 (`FalsifierEntry.demotedIf`) + G1 (DomainGraph)
  - edit:

    `canonicalProduct = 24`, `audit(n:sigma:phi:tau:jTwo:)` +
    `audit(_ result:)` (LatticeInvariantResult overload). 두 변형
    모두 nil 반환 = pass, `InvariantViolation` 반환 = fail 의
    failures list 보유. hexa-ufo / hexa-aura / hexa-cern / hexa-rtsc

    검증.
  - deps: G3 (sibling-repo 메타데이터 표준화)

## 12. Open axes (substrate-side · post-cell-flip)

This section tracks open work on **substrate-side parity axes**,
running parallel to the per-cell measured-oracle round structure of
§11.4. Each axis owns its own gate (g3 substrate · `measurement_gate`
flip) and lands independently of the §11.4 G-rounds. ARCH §12 carries
the narrative anchor + Tier-1/2/3 shape; detail SSOTs live in
`inbox/notes/`.

> **landing-axis distinction** — D80 endpoint rule (§0): per-cell
> `absorbed=true` (e.g. chip §B+§D κ-43 dynamic flip) is a separate
> axis from the **hexa-native parity port** axis tracked here. A cell
> can be `absorbed=true` while its substrate-axis `measurement_gate`
> is still OPEN; the §12 axes close the latter without changing the
> former. Closure of a §12 axis removes the `provisional=true`
> demotion risk implied by §0, but is NOT itself a cell flip.

  commits — `740964a0` G31a + `47c2378e` G31b). κ-69 opening 같은
  cycle 안에 G31 의 두 half 가 모두 branch 측 land. `[~]` 유지
  (PR merge 대기 · merge 시 `[x]` 로 flip). work 요약:

  - **smoke test PASS** (G31b acceptance):
    - mean_rel_err = **0.04967492** vs baseline 0.04988 ·
      threshold 0.05 → PASS margin doubled (0.00033 → 0.00067 ·

    - n_clearsky=480 · daylight=831 · dropped=351 (cloudy/cloud-

    - max_rel_err=0.22708 (clear-sky window 의 cloud-edge
      transient · honest documented in dataset_caveats)
    - `absorbed=true` `pass=true` 유지 (κ-68 G29 first-flip

    - bridge_stack = `"hexa_native_solar_position + pvlib
      Ineichen clearsky"` 으로 honest 갱신 (D80 §0 endpoint
      compliance · sun-position axis only · Ineichen 는 G31β)
  - **batch wrapper rationale**: Approach A (per-timestamp `hexa
    run`) = 1440 × ~10s cold-start = 4-hour infeasible. Approach
    B (batch wrapper · single subprocess loop internally) = 9s
    wall for 1440 zeniths. native binary 자체는 0.48s, cold-
    start overhead 가 dominant — batch 가 자연스러운 amortization.
  - **infra discoveries** (별 axis · note 박제):
    - `/tmp` output path 가 `hexa build` panic-trigger guard
      (April 2026 mac kernel-panic mitigation) 에 의해 차단 —
      batch wrapper 는 `hexa run` 만 사용해서 sidestep (run mode
      cached artifact path 사용)

  §11.4 G31 `[ ]` → `[~]` (partial · G31a ✓ / G31b pending). work

    = clean-room hexa-native `solar_kernel::apparent_zenith` (κ-65
    D80 g_hexa_only pilot).
  - **stdlib/sys avoidance**: 초기 build 가 `use "stdlib/sys"` 로
    인해 `read_line` undeclared 컴파일 에러. stdlib/sys 의
    `sys_stdin_read_line` 가 broken runtime symbol 참조 (별 axis ·
    upstream). wrapper 는 stdin 미사용 → `use "stdlib/sys"` drop +
    global builtins (`args()` · `exit()` · `println()` · `to_int()`
    · `to_float()`) 직접 사용. workaround pattern 박제.
  - **argv shape discovery**: `hexa run script.hexa user-args...`
    모드의 `args()` = `[cached_binary_path, ...user_args]` (no
    script_path slot in argv) — user args start at argv[1]. 초기
    offset 2 가 틀려서 usage error 트리거, debug print 으로 확인
