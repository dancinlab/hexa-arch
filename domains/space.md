## 1. "Design blueprint" deliverable

A mission trajectory + ΔV / maneuver plan, spacecraft bus sizing, and
(for launch / aero) outer-mould-line geometry — i.e. an optimized
coupled trajectory + vehicle definition.

## 2. Public-surface tool map (7-verb 1:1)

| verb | 오픈소스 | 상용 — 공개문서 한정 |
|---|---|---|
| 명세 SPECIFY | (Phase A system-level requirements; NASA SE Handbook) | — |
| 구조 ARCHITECT | (Phase A/B system architecture) | — |
| 설계 DESIGN | **NASA GMAT** (trajectory modelling, LEO → lunar → interplanetary); **OpenVSP** (parametric vehicle geometry) | — |
| 해석 ANALYZE ⟲ | **GMAT** trajectory optimization; **Basilisk** (spacecraft-centric mission / ADCS sim, faster-than-real-time); **NASA Trick** (end-to-end physics) | **AGI / Ansys STK** (mission analysis / visualization) — ⚠ *named from general knowledge, not retrieved source* |
| 합성 SYNTHESIZE | **OpenMDAO** (multidisciplinary analysis & optimization, coupled with GMAT for joint trajectory + system optimization); **OpenVSP3Plugin** (OpenVSP ↔ OpenMDAO bridge) | — |
| 검증 VERIFY | GMAT trajectory validation; Trick end-to-end sim | — |
| 인계 HANDOFF | (Phase D launch / production transition; deliverable per NASA SE Handbook) | — |

## 3. Notable proprietary (public docs only)

**AGI / Ansys STK** (Systems Tool Kit) is the well-known commercial
counterpart for mission analysis / visualization (public marketing
docs; ⚠ *not detailed in retrieved sources — flagged*). Open-vs-
proprietary gap here is the smallest of the six: NASA's open stack
(GMAT, OpenMDAO, OpenVSP, Trick, Basilisk) covers model → optimize →
sim end to end.

## 4. Biggest open-source gap

Unified, polished integrated environment / visualization & ops tooling
(the open pieces are strong individually but require glue code;
STK-class integration is proprietary).
