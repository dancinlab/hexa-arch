## 1. "Design blueprint" deliverable

A post-aural / temporal-bone clip device spec — multi-electrode dry / wet
EEG / EOG sensor array + reference, low-noise analog front-end + ADC,
BLE radio + antenna, battery + power management, biocompatible enclosure
+ ergonomic fit (mastoid / temporal-bone clip), plus FDA Class II design
dossier (21 CFR 820.30) and IEC 60601-1 + 60601-1-2 EMC dossier.

## 3. Notable proprietary (public docs only)

**Altium Designer**, **SolidWorks**, **ANSYS HFSS**, **Sim4Life** —
same EM / structural / safety-sim proprietary axis as `brain.md`, but
the regulatory bar is lower for a non-implantable wearable (Class II
vs Class III). Sim4Life's FDA MDDT status for MRI-safety evaluation
(ASTM F2182-19e2 passive implants, ISO 10974 active implants — IMAnalytics
V3.0 + MRIxViP V2.1) remains the singular irreplaceable proprietary
tool for any device that may end up in an MRI bore. EEG-specific
proprietary acquisition (BrainVision Analyzer, Neuroscan Curry) exists
but MNE-Python is an established research-grade replacement.

## 4. Biggest open-source gap

Validated open-source RF / SAR / MRI-safety simulator at Sim4Life
parity, with regulatory acceptance. openEMS handles antenna + field
solving credibly but is not FDA-MDDT-qualified and has no validated
ISO 10974 / ASTM F2182-class workflow. For wearable BCI this is a
softer gap than for `brain.md`'s implant case but still binding for
MRI-safety labeling.
