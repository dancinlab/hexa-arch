## 1. "Design blueprint" deliverable

Coil winding geometry + conductor (REBCO / Bi-2212) layout, field map,
current / critical-state distribution, AC-loss and quench / stress
budget.

## 2. Public-surface tool map (7-verb 1:1)

| 해석 ANALYZE ⟲ | **HTS Modelling Workgroup** shared REBCO / HTS critical-state model files | **ANSYS Maxwell**, **COMSOL**, **Opera**, **JMAG** (3-D coupled EM-thermal-quench) |

## 3. Notable proprietary (public docs only)

**ANSYS Maxwell**, **COMSOL Multiphysics**, **Opera**, **JMAG**. ANSYS
A-V formulation is widely used for REBCO tape-stack magnetization
(HTS workgroup public ref). Gap is large for **3-D, multiphysics
(EM + thermal + structural quench)** HTS modelling — open FEMM is
essentially 2-D / axisymmetric; the 3-D HTS coupled workflow is
dominated by ANSYS / COMSOL.

## 4. Biggest open-source gap

3-D coupled EM–thermal–mechanical quench / AC-loss simulation for
REBCO / Bi-2212 coils (open tooling is 2-D-limited).
