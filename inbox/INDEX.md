# inbox/INDEX.md — cross-session pickup SSOT

> Updated 2026-05-20 (post κ-67 RFC 013 promotion of hexa-native connection plan).
> Status SSOT for every `inbox/notes/*.md` entry. Each entry keeps
> its own body intact; this file is the at-a-glance index.

## Legend

- **resolved** — completed, landed on origin/main; note kept as audit
- **superseded** — covered by a newer entry / decision
- **pickup-open** — actionable, awaits dependency or session
- **pickup-blocked** — toolchain / cross-session dependency
- **archive** — reference / methodology, no further action

## Maintenance

When a note is resolved: add a status line at the head of the note
AND update this INDEX. When a new note lands: append a row here in
the same sweep.
