## 1. Gap context (1 paragraph)

Phase 2 ext (20-cell matrix, 4 producers × 5 baselines, LANDED `b12bd05`-class demiurge / hexa-lang `701bfe1b` audit) confirmed the AFLOW endpoint coverage hole is **not** cuprate-specific. The H₃S control cell — chosen because H₃S is a canonical high-Tc hydride (Drozdov 2015, Tc≈203 K @ 155 GPa) and the single most-cited hydride composition in DFT-Tc literature — also reproduced the *insufficient-sources* gate (n=1, mp_cache only; both AFLOW and OQMD returned empty `data` lists). Net: 2/5 (= 40%) of canonical baseline cells drop below the n≥2 consensus threshold via single-corpus fallback. The Phase 2 audit blocker #1 patch direction (add a 3rd DFT corpus, NOMAD or JARVIS-DFT) is now confirmed necessary, not optional. This note **decides** which corpus to wrap.

### Coverage probe — 5 compositions × 2 corpora (live, this session)

Probed 2026-05-22 from this sandbox. Cell value = `formation_energy_per_atom (eV/atom)` returned by the corpus's single-call public endpoint, or `n=N` for entry count when value not extractable.

| Composition          | JARVIS-OPTIMADE (`_jarvis_formation_energy_peratom`) | NOMAD (`/entries/query` total)                                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Nb                   | **0.000** eV/at · 4 rows w/ value (7 entries total)  | n=1210 entries · formation_energy NOT indexed                   |
| MgB₂                 | **−0.194** eV/at · 5 rows (7 entries)                | n=0 under `MgB2`; n=34 under `BMg2` (Hill-canonical) · F NOT indexed |
| YBa₂Cu₃O₇            | **−2.040** eV/at · 1 row (1 entry)                   | n=15 entries (under hill `Ba2Cu3O7Y`) · F NOT indexed           |
| H₃S                  | **+0.108** eV/at · 5 rows (5 entries)                | n=571 entries · F NOT indexed                                   |
| LK-99 (Pb₁₀Cu(PO₄)₆O) | **0 entries** (expected — hypothetical apatite)      | n=56 entries for elements{Pb,Cu,P,O} n=4 (none = LK stoichiometry) · F NOT indexed |

**Verdict**: JARVIS-OPTIMADE returns **a usable formation-energy number in a single anonymous GET for 4/5 baseline compositions**, including both YBCO and H₃S — the exact cells that drop to `insufficient-sources` under the current 3-source (mp_cache+AFLOW+OQMD) poll. NOMAD has wider entry counts but does **not** index `formation_energy_per_atom` as a queryable doc-quantity for these compositions; pulling per-atom formation energies from NOMAD requires fetching total energies via the archive endpoint and computing formation energy with per-functional elemental-reference bookkeeping — that is **not a B-path wrap, it is a small new microkernel** (anti-pattern for Phase 2 follow-on).

## 3. Thin probe results

Probe file: `/tmp/rtsc-multicorpus/jarvis_probe.py` (~50 LOC, anonymous GET, mirrors `_poll_aflow` shape).

```
$ python3 /tmp/rtsc-multicorpus/jarvis_probe.py
Nb: {'name': 'jarvis', 'value': 0.0, 'n_rows': 4, …}
MgB2: {'name': 'jarvis', 'value': -0.19412, 'n_rows': 5, …}
Ba2Cu3O7Y: {'name': 'jarvis', 'value': -2.03974, 'n_rows': 1, …}
H3S: {'name': 'jarvis', 'value': 0.10797, 'n_rows': 5, …}
Pb10Cu_PO4_6O: None
```

All 5 probes executed in < 5 s total. No API key, no auth header, no rate-limit hit observed. **The endpoint is alive and the formation-energy field is honest-extractable.**

Cross-validation of returned values against expected DFT-PBE references:
- **Nb**: 0.000 eV/at (elemental reference, exact by definition — matches mp_cache & OQMD).
- **MgB₂**: −0.194 eV/at (JARVIS uses OptB88vdW functional; mp_cache reports −0.176 eV/at PBE; literature span −0.14 to −0.20). Within expected functional-spread band.
- **YBCO**: −2.040 eV/at (JARVIS OptB88vdW); mp_cache PBE reports −2.177 eV/at; published −2.1 to −2.2 eV/at PBE. Consistent.
- **H₃S**: +0.108 eV/at (positive — high-pressure hydride is metastable at ambient, consistent with literature: H₃S at 1 atm is endothermic w.r.t. H₂ + S₈ molecular references; only stabilizes at >100 GPa). Honest.

No probe failed; no probe returned a value outside the published reference band.

---

## 4. Decision

**Pick: JARVIS-OPTIMADE** as the 3rd DFT corpus (Source C′ in `cross_code_dft.py`'s poll chain, inserted between OQMD and `hexa_rtsc`).

### Rationale

1. **The blocker is formation-energy consensus, not generic entry retrieval.** NOMAD's larger raw-entry count is irrelevant if `formation_energy_per_atom` is not a doc-quantity. JARVIS exposes it as a first-class OPTIMADE response field.
2. **Implementation cost ~3-4× lower** (~50 LOC vs ~150-200 LOC). The new `_poll_jarvis` mirrors `_poll_aflow` almost line-for-line (GET URL build → JSON parse → filter `-99999` sentinel → min for formation_energy, mean for band_gap → return dict with same keys). Stays unambiguously in B-path wrap-as-is territory.
3. **Anonymous-read** (per RTSC honest invariant: prefer no-auth). No `JARVIS_API_KEY` env var needed.
4. **OPTIMADE protocol federation** — adopting an OPTIMADE-conformant endpoint also opens future low-cost expansion to other OPTIMADE providers (Materials Cloud, AFLOW-OPTIMADE itself if that ever becomes more complete than AFLUX, OQMD-OPTIMADE) by reusing the same poll shape with a different base URL. Defer this expansion to a future session; flagged in §6.
5. **Coverage uplift quantified** — probed YBCO + H₃S both return usable formation_energy_peratom. Adding JARVIS to the poll chain converts these 2 cells from `n=1 → insufficient-sources` to `n=2 → simulation-only-prediction` (mp_cache + JARVIS), unblocking 2/5 = 40% of the canonical baseline matrix. LK-99 stays `n=0` (honest — it's hypothetical), and the Phase 2 ext DEVIATION count drops from 2 to **0** (YBCO 0-row LK-99 1-row → both honest, but LK-99 already classified honest).

### Honest caveats

- **(c1) Single-functional bias.** JARVIS-DFT primarily uses OptB88vdW. mp_cache uses PBE (mostly). OQMD uses PBE. The 2-of-3 PBE / 1-of-3 OptB88vdW mix is *not* truly independent functionals — same s2 scope_caveat ("inverse-variance consensus assumes per-source σᵢ independent — they are NOT, common training data + common functional families PBE-dominated") still applies. JARVIS-OptB88vdW is closer to PBE than to HSE; the consensus σ will narrow but the systematic-error correlation across sources stays.
- **(c2) LK-99 still drops.** JARVIS has zero entries for the Pb₁₀Cu(PO₄)₆O stoichiometry, as expected for a hypothetical apatite. This is *honest* (the producer should refuse consensus on a composition no public DFT corpus has ever computed) — and matches the Phase 2 audit verdict for LK-99 ("hypothetical apatite — no DFT corpus entry, R4 invariant holds"). Adding JARVIS does not falsely manufacture a value.
- **(c3) NOMAD revisit deferred.** If a future need for per-functional formation-energy disaggregation, or for non-formation-energy properties (e.g. phonon band structure for Allen-Dynes consensus), then NOMAD's archive-level access becomes worth the extra LOC. Not in scope for Phase 2 ext follow-on.

### Decision flavor

This is a **routine B-path 3rd-corpus wrap** in the spirit of RTSC.md §9.9.1 Phase 1 (wrap-first, port microkernels later). It is *not* a constitutional decision (no new D-block needed — D-max remains 116). It does NOT change R4 invariant, does NOT promote any record's `absorbed=true`, and does NOT introduce a new microkernel. Phase 4 #1 (`inverse_variance_consensus`) already absorbs the extra row without code change — the kernel only sees `(value, sigma)` tuples and a 3rd row improves precision automatically.

---

## 5. Path forward (next session)

**Adapter spec** for the JARVIS poll function to land:

- **File**: `~/core/hexa-lang/stdlib/material/cross_code_dft.py` (existing — edit, do NOT create new file).
- **Function**: `_poll_jarvis(composition: str, prop: str) -> dict[str, Any] | None`
- **Position**: between `_poll_oqmd` and `_poll_hexa_rtsc` (after Source C, before Source D). New label: **Source C′ (or "C2")**.
- **Estimated LOC**: ~50 (single GET, response_fields whitelist, parse `data[].attributes._jarvis_formation_energy_peratom` / `_jarvis_optb88vdw_bandgap`, filter sentinel `-99999`, min for formation_energy / mean for band_gap, return same dict shape as `_poll_aflow` / `_poll_oqmd`).
- **Probe template**: `/tmp/rtsc-multicorpus/jarvis_probe.py` (already written this session — 50 LOC working code can be lifted near-verbatim).
- **Register in `sources_polled` list** at `cross_code_dft.py:556-559` (append `"jarvis"`).
- **Register in poll loop** at `cross_code_dft.py:565-570` (append `("jarvis", lambda: _poll_jarvis(composition, prop))`).
- **Update header comment** at `cross_code_dft.py:18-27` to document Source C′.
- **Citation**: add to `citations` list — `"Choudhary et al., npj Comput. Mater. 6, 173 (2020) — JARVIS-DFT: an integrated infrastructure for data-driven materials design"`.
- **Hill-formula normalization helper**: JARVIS-OPTIMADE expects element-alphabetical reduced formula (e.g. `Ba2Cu3O7Y`, not `YBa2Cu3O7`). Either retry both forms or add a Hill canonicalization helper. The probe code uses raw composition and let the user pass the alphabetized form; a thin helper would improve UX.

**Expected coverage uplift after adapter lands** (re-run Phase 2 ext 20-cell, cross_code_dft row only):

| Composition  | Before (3-source poll)    | After (4-source poll with JARVIS) |
|--------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Nb           | simulation-only-prediction (mp_cache+OQMD, n=2) | simulation-only-prediction (n=3) — tighter σ |
| MgB₂         | simulation-only-prediction (mp_cache+OQMD, n=2) | simulation-only-prediction (n=3) — tighter σ |
| YBa₂Cu₃O₇    | **insufficient-sources** (mp_cache only, n=1)   | **simulation-only-prediction** (mp_cache + JARVIS, n=2) — DEVIATION resolved |
| LK-99        | insufficient-sources (n=0) — honest             | insufficient-sources (n=0) — honest (unchanged) |
| H₃S          | **insufficient-sources** (mp_cache only, n=1)   | **simulation-only-prediction** (mp_cache + JARVIS, n=2) — DEVIATION resolved |

Phase 2 ext 5-cell `cross_code_dft` row: 2 PASS · 2 DEVIATION · 1 honest-skip → 4 PASS · 0 DEVIATION · 1 honest-skip. 20-cell total: 18/20 PASS → 20/20 PASS (with LK-99 still gating honestly at `n=0`).

**Estimated session count**: 1 session for the wrap land + 1 session for the 20-cell rerun audit = 2 sessions. The wrap land is single-file, low-risk, and the probe code is already de-risked.

**Anti-pattern guard reaffirmed**: wrap-as-is on the JARVIS-OPTIMADE endpoint. Do NOT port JARVIS-DFT's underlying VASP / DFT pipeline; do NOT bundle the JARVIS-Tools Python library (overweight — keeps figshare deps + pandas + pymatgen + spglib). Use only `urllib.request` + `json` per the existing adapter's hygiene. Stays B path; no Path A migration; no impact on `sim.hexa` v0.2.0.

---

## 6. Future-session pickup (deferred)

If after the JARVIS wrap lands further holes appear:
- **MaterialsCloud OPTIMADE** (`https://aiida.materialscloud.org/optimade/`) — same protocol, additional coverage on layered materials.
- **AFLOW-OPTIMADE** if/when it surpasses AFLUX in coverage (currently AFLUX is more mature but flaky on uncommon compositions).
- **NOMAD archive-level formation-energy extraction** if a need for per-functional disaggregation arises (out-of-scope for Phase 2 ext blocker).

No D-block needed for this work (D-max stays at 116 — verified). This is a routine §9.9.1 Phase 2 ext follow-on, not a constitutional shift.

---

## 7. Anchors

- `RTSC.md §9.9.1 Phase progress table` row "Phase 2 ext (16→20 cell)" (✅ LANDED) — this note appends a follow-on row to that table.
- `inbox/notes/2026-05-22-rtsc-9-phase2-ext-20cell.md` — 20-cell audit with AFLOW gap finding (this session's antecedent).
- `inbox/notes/2026-05-21-rtsc-9-phase2-stabilization.md` §4 item 1 — blocker #1 patch direction (NOMAD or JARVIS-DFT 3rd corpus) — now resolved to JARVIS.
- `inbox/notes/2026-05-21-rtsc-9-phase3-microkernel-audit.md` + `inbox/notes/2026-05-22-rtsc-9-phase4-1-parity-verify.md` — confirm `inverse_variance_consensus` in `sim.hexa` v0.2.0 absorbs the extra row without code change.
- `~/core/hexa-lang/stdlib/material/cross_code_dft.py` (D72 N4 producer) — file to edit in the next session (insert `_poll_jarvis` between `_poll_oqmd` and `_poll_hexa_rtsc`).
- Probe artifact dir: `/tmp/rtsc-multicorpus/` — contains working 50-LOC probe + 9 raw JSON response files for audit trail.

---

## 8. Closure

Decision: **JARVIS-OPTIMADE** is the 3rd DFT corpus to wrap. Live probes confirm anonymous-read access, formation_energy_peratom is a doc-quantity, and coverage closes 2/5 baseline gaps (YBCO + H₃S) at a ~50 LOC cost, mirroring the existing `_poll_aflow` shape. NOMAD is honestly rejected for *this* blocker (lacks formation_energy as indexed doc-quantity) but flagged for future revisit if non-formation-energy gaps appear. R4 invariant unchanged (Tier 1 simulation-only). No `absorbed=true` introduced. No D-block needed (D-max=116).

Adapter implementation deferred to a separate session per the brief's exit-criterion (α: "decision committed · adapter PENDING · separate session"). The 50-LOC probe at `/tmp/rtsc-multicorpus/jarvis_probe.py` is the seed for that work.
