# JARVIS adapter cross-pollution recovery note

> Date: 2026-05-22
> Trigger: Phase 2 ext follow-on JARVIS-OPTIMADE adapter agent (`a7fc44a7ae15ea31c`) completed Exit α. demiurge side LANDED (`c2ccd17a`). **hexa-lang side cross-polluted** — commit `a68d3ac1` landed on `dfflibmap-sky130-reset-flop-variants-2026-05-22` branch (concurrent agent's branch) instead of `main`.

## What happened

1. Agent committed JARVIS adapter to isolated worktree `~/core/hexa-lang-jarvis` on branch `phase2-jarvis-adapter-2026-05-22` at commit `d3a3f8e8`.
2. Worktree + branch cleanup ran successfully via `git worktree remove` + `git branch -D`.
3. Cherry-pick attempted from `~/core/hexa-lang` main worktree using `git cherry-pick d3a3f8e8`.
4. **Main worktree's HEAD had been silently switched** to `dfflibmap-sky130-reset-flop-variants-2026-05-22` branch (by a concurrent agent · matches the `feedback_hexa_lang_concurrent_agents` memory pattern).
5. Cherry-pick produced new commit `a68d3ac1` ON THAT branch (NOT main). The content (JARVIS adapter +143/-4 in `stdlib/material/cross_code_dft.py`) is correct, only the branch parent is wrong.
6. Recovery via `git checkout main` failed: `fatal: 'main' is already used by worktree at '/Users/ghost/core/hexa-lang/.claude/worktrees/agent-afeb2bb7643b71ee6'`. That locked worktree has main at `f618bb96` with **10+ staged `A` files** (concurrent agent's mid-commit speckit work).
7. Per `[[feedback-hexa-lang-concurrent-agents]]` memory rule, don't fix someone else's branch. File this note instead.

## Cross-check: demiurge side claim vs hexa-lang reality

The demiurge audit note `2026-05-22-rtsc-9-phase2-jarvis-rerun.md` cites the hexa-lang adapter at SHA `d3a3f8e8` (which exists as ancestor of `a68d3ac1` in the orphan branch). The 20-cell rerun records at `/tmp/phase2-jarvis-rerun/` were emitted by the adapter via the isolated worktree run, so the 20/20 PASS claim is empirically valid — but the adapter code is **not yet on hexa-lang main**.

R4 invariant: 0/20 records absorbed=true confirmed during rerun. Cross-pollution does NOT affect record-level honesty.

## Recovery path for next session

When the locked `agent-afeb2bb7643b71ee6` worktree is released (concurrent agent finishes their speckit commit OR worktree is force-removed after they're idle):

```
# Option A: cherry-pick a68d3ac1 to main
cd /Users/ghost/core/hexa-lang   # or wherever main becomes available
git checkout main
git cherry-pick a68d3ac1

# Option B: if a68d3ac1 has drifted (other agent rebased the dfflibmap branch),
# pull the commit content via SHA → git cat-file -e a68d3ac1 first to verify it still exists

# Option C: re-run the adapter agent on a fresh branch from current main
# (simplest if a68d3ac1 is gone)
```

After cherry-pick lands on hexa-lang main, demiurge needs no follow-up — `c2ccd17a` already documents the state.

## Recommendation for the dfflibmap branch owner

The `dfflibmap-sky130-reset-flop-variants-2026-05-22` branch owner (some concurrent agent doing RFC 006 §5 Path-c dffe variant work) will see `a68d3ac1` appear in their branch. They have two options:
- Keep it (JARVIS adapter is additive, no conflict expected with dfflibmap work)
- Rebase it out via `git rebase -i` to drop `a68d3ac1` from their branch (cleaner separation)

Either way, this note serves as the audit record explaining how `a68d3ac1` landed there.

## Why this happened (root cause)

The hexa-lang main worktree at `/Users/ghost/core/hexa-lang` is shared with concurrent automated agents who switch branches and stage files during normal work. The branch switch from `main` → `dfflibmap-sky130-reset-flop-variants-2026-05-22` happened between the time I read `git status` (which showed main) and the time I executed the cherry-pick. No way to atomically prevent this without holding a lock the harness doesn't provide.

Per memory rule: combine `git add && git commit` to avoid wrong-branch landings. The same hazard applies to `git checkout main && git cherry-pick` sequences. Recommended pattern for future sessions: explicit `git -C <isolated-worktree-path>` for ALL operations, never operate in the shared main worktree.
