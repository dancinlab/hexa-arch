# RFC 006 — Yosys absorption (RTL→netlist synthesis)

> Status: **draft / design only — NOT complete** · 2026-05-18 ·
> Source: rfc_004 §5 Phase 2 + `design.md` D15 (modules ⊂ hexa-lang/
> stdlib) + g3 (measured gate, never asserted). Pattern mirror:

## 1. Purpose

Clean-room re-derive the **minimal Yosys subset** that takes
synthesizable Verilog RTL → a SKY130 gate-level netlist — the
**SYNTHESIZE**-verb tool for the chip domain (HANDOFF §4/§5), the
EDA-pipeline stage immediately after the NoC-sim (rfc_001/003).

## 2. Why now / parity target already exists

comb's T3 work already produced the exact reference this absorption
must reproduce (g3 — a real pre-measured oracle, no fabrication):

- RTL: `archive/comb/rtl/orfs/sky130hd/router_d{4,6}/router_d{4,6}.v`
- Yosys-produced netlists: `archive/comb/rtl/synth_netlists/
  router_d{4,6}.sky130.v`
- Measured SKY130 area (comb yosys+abc): d4 = **61,762.99 µm²**,
  d6 = **93,608.53 µm²** → ratio **1.5156×** (HANDOFF §4 oracle;
  also the `router_port_area_norm = 1.516` used in every F1F2
  record). **This is the §5 measurement-gate target.**

## 3. Clean-room scope (public-surface, D1)

Yosys = `github.com/YosysHQ/yosys` (ISC license, OSS — public-surface
OK; cite commit + license; no code copied — re-derive by inspection).
Minimal RTL→sky130-netlist flow only (NOT all of Yosys):

```
read_verilog  → proc → opt → memory → techmap → dfflibmap
              → abc(-liberty sky130_fd_sc_hd) → opt_clean → write_verilog
```

Everything outside that path (formal, SAT, FPGA backends, the full
RTLIL pass library) is out of scope.

## 4. Module breakdown (hexa-native → `hexa-lang/stdlib/yosys/`, D15)

Per D15 the modules live in hexa-lang/stdlib; this RFC (design) lives
in hexa-arch/proposals; hexa-arch references as consumer.

| module | re-derives (clean-room, cited) |
|---|---|
| `rtlil.hexa` | the RTLIL in-memory IR (modules/cells/wires) |
| `read_verilog.hexa` | synthesizable-subset Verilog frontend → RTLIL |
| `passes.hexa` | proc · opt · memory · techmap · dfflibmap · opt_clean |
| `liberty.hexa` | SKY130 `sky130_fd_sc_hd` `.lib` parse (cell areas/timing) |
| `abc_map.hexa` | tech-mapping to the liberty cells — **see §7, the hard part** |
| `write_verilog.hexa` | RTLIL → gate-level Verilog netlist |
| `yosys.hexa` | dispatcher (rfc_048 idiom; hexa-lang toolchain limits: no `match`, enum-eq broken, no tuples — int/struct idioms) |

Each module: `#!hexa strict`, top clean-room provenance block, per-fn
`// CLEAN-ROOM` markers, `fn main()` self-test, `exit(91)` fail-loud
(rfc_003 established idiom).

## 5. g3 measurement gate — when "absorbed" may be claimed

`absorbed` flips ONLY when, under the hexa-lang/stdlib/yosys tree:

- the flow synthesizes `comb router_d4.v` + `router_d6.v` against
  SKY130 `sky130_fd_sc_hd`, and
- the resulting **cell area reproduces comb's oracle within stated
  tolerance** — d4 ≈ 61,763 µm², d6 ≈ 93,609 µm², **ratio
  1.516× ± (tolerance TBD, propose ±5 %)**, and
- filed in `PLAN.md` with cited numbers.

Until then: program-in-progress, GATE-style (rfc_003 idiom). No line
may say "Yosys absorbed" before this gate.

## 6. Location / consumer

Modules → `hexa-lang/stdlib/yosys/` (D15, hexa-lang commit, unpushed
pending hexa-lang review — booksim/d5a63a82 precedent). hexa-arch
references it as the chip-domain SYNTHESIZE tool; this RFC is the
design only.

## 7. The hard part — ABC tech-mapping (honest, g3)

Yosys shells out to **ABC** (Berkeley logic-synthesis, also OSS) for
the actual technology mapping (`abc -liberty`). Clean-room
re-derivation of ABC's mapping/optimization is a *very large*
program (≫ rfc_003). Two paths, a real decision (**D18, open**):

- **(7a) bounded-subprocess** — re-derive the Yosys flow hexa-native
  but invoke ABC as a documented absorbed-substrate subprocess,
  fail-loud (rfc_048/D14 precedent, bounded g5 exception). Fast,
  reproduces the oracle now; ABC re-derivation = scheduled follow-on.
- **(7b) full ABC re-derivation now** — months, rate-limit-prone;
  not recommended as the first step.
- recommend **(7a)** — parity with the rfc_048/D14 hybrid precedent.

Other open: SKY130 `.lib` parse scope; synthesizable-subset coverage
of `read_verilog` (router_d{4,6}.v is small/clean — scope to what it
needs first).

## 8. What is NOT done (g3 honesty)

No modules written; nothing synthesized; no "Yosys absorbed" claim.
This RFC is **design only**. The clean-room modules are subsequent
rate-limit-safe scoped work (rfc_003 pattern), gated by §5.
