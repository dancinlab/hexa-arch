// MobilityRecord — phase κ-41 (P-⑧ 5th cohort producer prototype, D63).
//
// Typed sidecar for a `mobility + analyze` producer run — the FIFTH
// cohort domain (after sscb κ-34, energy κ-38, …) wired to a real
// measuring engine tool, and the FIRST mobility / autonomous-driving
// cell. osmnx (MIT, OpenStreetMap road-network analysis) is the
// producer; demiurge spawns it and persists the topology measurements
// as a typed record.
//
// rfc_002 §4 F1F2-style discipline (mirror SSCBRecord / EnergyRecord /
// MatterRecord / ComponentRecord): producer pinned to the library
// identity, measurement_gate honest, scope_caveats embedded with the
// record.
//
// HONESTY (g3 — non-negotiable):
//   * producer = "osmnx@<version>" — pins the library, NOT the
//     road-network data. The current producer builds a *synthetic
//     10x10 Manhattan grid topology fixture* (no real OSM extract,
//     no Overpass network call) so the record is reproducible byte-
//     for-byte across hosts. osmnx.basic_stats() and networkx
//     diameter computation ARE standard graph algorithms — the
//     numbers are real measurements OF the synthetic grid.
//   * absorbed = false — ALWAYS. Same BANNED-absorbed stance as
//     SSCBRecord and EnergyRecord. Real "absorbed" mobility-analyze
//     would need a real OSM extract (or HD map) for a named place,
//     a calibrated traffic-demand matrix, and a SUMO / CARLA micro-
//     simulation validated against measured travel times. None are
//     in scope here.
//   * scope_caveats records that the graph is a *topology fixture*
//     (NOT real Manhattan), that NO traffic flow / travel time /
//     vehicle simulation is run, and that the cell intentionally
//     stops at the road-graph topology layer to keep cohort
//     breadth-coverage tractable.
