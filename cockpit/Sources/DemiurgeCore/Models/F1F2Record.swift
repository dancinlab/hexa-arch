// F1F2Record — Codable mirror of rfc_002 v1.0 schema (the chip:noc:F1F2 typed
// record produced by demiurge[chip] for downstream consumers).
//
// rfc_002 §3 (schema) + §4 (provenance / no-over-claim required fields).
// Forward-compat per rfc_002 §6 unknown-key idiom: this struct decodes only
// the fields the consumer renders; Swift Codable already ignores extra keys,
// so producer schema growth never breaks the cockpit.
//
// Phase α-3 (rfc_011 §10): moved into the DemiurgeCore library target so
// both CockpitApp (GUI) and DemiurgeCLI (headless) can share this single
// typed-interface model. All members are `public` so cross-module access
// works; the Codable synthesised init(from:) stays internal but that is
// fine — JSONDecoder.decode is invoked from inside DemiurgeCore
// (RecordLoader), and the consumer modules only read public properties.
//
// @D g_cockpit_isolation (a): this file decodes records read from
// ../exports/** only; it neither imports nor writes any producer-side state.
