// GridRecord — phase κ-36 (P-⑧ cohort producer prototype, D57).
//
// Typed sidecar for a `grid + structure` producer run — the SECOND
// cohort domain (after κ-34 / D55's `sscb + analyze` ngspice producer)
// wired to a real measuring engine tool. NetworkX 3.2.1 is the
// producer; demiurge spawns it and persists the graph-theoretic
// measurements as a typed record.
//
// rfc_002 §4 F1F2-style discipline (mirror SSCBRecord / MatterRecord /
// ComponentRecord / F1F2Record): producer pinned to the library
// identity, measurement_gate honest, scope_caveats embedded.
//
// HONESTY (g3 — non-negotiable):
//   • producer = "networkx@<version>" — pins the library, NOT the
//     real-world fabric. IEEE 14-bus is a *published reference test
//     case* (Christie 1962, UW Power Systems Test Case Archive,
//     pglib-opf `case14`). The TOPOLOGY is canonical and the metrics
//     NetworkX computes ARE deterministic mathematical facts —
//     therefore measurement_gate = GATE_CLOSED_MEASURED is HONEST
//     here (the graph IS the measurement; same epistemic class as a
//     F1F2 chip record).
//   • absorbed = false ALWAYS — NetworkX is an EXTERNAL Python
//     library, not absorbed into hexa-lang stdlib. The day a
//     `hexa-graph` re-computes these numerically-identically, the
//     absorbed flip happens elsewhere — NOT in Swift.
//   • SCOPE CAVEATS surface three honest gaps:
//       1. IEEE 14-bus is a POWER-GRID reference; the demiurge
//          `grid` domain is AI DATACENTER fabric. Producer
//          demonstrates the WIRING on a canonical graph the field
//          has measured — NOT a real DC fat-tree manifest.
//       2. bisection_min_cut_edges counts LINKS, NOT Gbps. No
//          SerDes channel model. The "real" DC bisection bandwidth
//          gate lives in ns-3 / SST (domains/grid.md §2 ANALYZE)
//          + HFSS / Sigrity SI (§4 gap).
//       3. NetworkX is external — demiurge witnesses, NetworkX
//          measures. The mirror of D17 (hexa-matter is owner,
//          demiurge is consumer) for graph-theoretic verbs.
