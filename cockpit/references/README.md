# cockpit/references/ — design inspiration + validation assets

> Reference assets cited by `proposals/rfc_009_product_surface_macos_cockpit.md`
> (`rfc_009`), `proposals/rfc_010_cockpit_architecture.md` (`rfc_010`), and
> `proposals/rfc_011_cockpit_control_surface.md` (`rfc_011`). Two kinds:
> **design inspiration** (external prior art the cockpit borrows visual
> patterns from) and **measured validation** (screenshots from the
> cockpit's own user-side runs that prove the design renders as designed).

## Index

| File | Kind | Cited by | Source | Note |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ------ | ---- |
| `quiver-overview.png` | inspiration | rfc_010 §2 | Palantir Foundry Quiver "Overview Analysis" capture, 2026-05-19 (user-provided) | 3-pane SplitView + `$<id>` card tokens + selection-bound inspector pattern that rfc_010 mirrors. NOT a copy: the cockpit adds honesty-mode (gate chips, REJECTED cards, Provenance verbatim) which Quiver does not have. |
| `screenshot-2026-05-19-0347.png` | validation | PLAN.md, design.md D29 supersede-forward | user-side `swift run` capture of D29 + Phase α landing on Mac Mini, 2026-05-19 03:47 KST | First *visual proof* that honesty-as-feature renders correctly: orange GATE_OPEN chip + `absorbed: false` + 5 `scope_caveats` verbatim, matching D29's design.md prediction. |
| `bipv-module-exploded-isometric.jpg` | inspiration | rfc_011 §7 (`ComponentMode` canvas mode) | aluminiummagazine.com BIPV (Building-Integrated PhotoVoltaic) module construction diagram | Exploded-isometric "feel" the user wants for the `component` domain (D21) canvas mode: glass face / PV cells / corrosion-proof frame / thermal sink / structural mount visibly stacked with annotated layers. RealityKit (D35) renders this style; mouse-drag rotates the stack. |
| `screenshot-2026-05-21-1408-cockpit-empty-state.png` | validation | rfc_010 §2 (3-pane SplitView), rfc_011 (control surface) | user-side `swift run` capture of CockpitApp empty-project shell on Mac Mini, 2026-05-21 14:08 KST | First *visual proof* that the empty-state shell renders with all three panes wired: 7-verb sidebar (무엇을 / 어떻게 / 설계 / 점검 / 해석 / 만들기 / 검증 / 넘기기), chat layer ("요리 선생님"), verb tray (무엇을 → 넘기기 chips), and ingredient shelf (재료 선반) with empty-state CTA. Korean UI strings + light-mode default match rfc_011 control-surface spec. |
| `screenshot-2026-05-21-1408-rtsc-view3d-hts-solenoid.png` | validation | rfc_011 §7 (`ComponentMode` canvas mode for non-BIPV domain), HTS coil test window | user-side `./cockpit/test-3d-hts.sh` capture of `HtsView3D` standalone test window on Mac Mini, 2026-05-21 14:08 KST | First *visual proof* that the HTS-solenoid proxy (77K REBCO, concrete) renders as designed: 6 concentric annular rings (Bore / Cold Mass Support / HTS Coil / Cold Mass Jacket / Radiation Shield / Cryostat OVC) with translucent cryostat shells and gold REBCO helix winding visible through the translucent HTS Coil sleeve. Header carries the honesty trio: `L 200 mm · turns 120 · 6 rings` + `g3 · GATE_OPEN · procedural HTS proxy` — the same honesty-mode contract from `screenshot-2026-05-19-0347.png`, now extended to the 3D canvas mode for the HTS coil (77K REBCO proxy, not BIPV). Geometry source: `DemiurgeCore/Models/HtsCoilGeometry.swift` `htsSolenoidProxy`. |

## Provenance discipline (`@D g_cockpit_isolation` invariant a)

These assets live under `cockpit/references/`, NOT `../exports/**`. They are
**design references**, not committed *measured records* — the cockpit reads
them only as static images shown in docs/RFCs and (eventually) as
in-app "inspiration" credits. They MUST NOT be treated as provenance-bearing
records (no gate state, no `absorbed` field, no atlas citation). The
honesty-mode rules (`rfc_009` §4) apply to `../exports/**` records only.

## How to add a new reference

1. Copy the file into this directory with a descriptive lowercase-hyphen name
   (avoid spaces / non-ASCII for git portability).
2. Add a row to the Index above.
3. Cite it from the appropriate RFC section.
4. If it is a measured validation screenshot, cross-reference the
   corresponding `design.md` decision and PLAN.md log entry.
